		README FILE FOR THE MIXAL DISTRIBUTION

This is an assembler and interpreter for Donald Knuth's mythical MIX computer,
defined in:

Donald Knuth, _The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. 1: Fundamental 
  Algorithms_.  Addison-Wesley, 1973 (2nd ed.)

This is *not* the GNU MIX Development Kit.  You can find that at:

	http://gnu.essentkabel.com/software/mdk/mdk.html

This implementation was designed and written by Darius Bacon
<djello@well.sf.ca.us>, then ported to UNIX and debugged by Eric S. Raymond
<esr@snark.thyrsus.com>.  Corrections to multiplication and division by
Larry Gately <lgately@rohan.btg.com>; see Notes.

		AUTHOR'S IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

There is one significant difference in the assembler format: Knuth puts
fields at fixed offsets on a line, while I separate them by whitespace.
(Purists may wish to fix this obvious bug.)

The tape devices are currently unimplemented.  (Use the 'card punch'
and 'printer' devices if you don't need mass storage.  They're
automatically connected to standard input and output.

Floating-point instructions aren't implemented either.  They weren't
covered in Volume I, which is all I've got so far.

This MIX is a binary machine.  I think that was a mistake -- decimal
would make debugging enough nicer to compensate for the decreased
efficiency.  When dumping internal values, it prints them in octal, so
you can get the field values by inspection.

Things to do are marked by a comment starting with **. 
The program still needs more testing.

			PORTING AND TESTING

The code is written in pure ANSI C.  It is known to work in the
following environments:

	OS		Compiler
	-----------	------------
	BSD/386		gcc
	AIX-3.2.5	gcc
	DOS		Watcom C
	DOS		Borland C

You can regression-test the interpreter with mixtest (under UNIX) or
test.bat (under DOS).
